# splines_viewer
A tool for visualizing and manipulating Beziers, Splines and Lagrange interpolation curves.

# Installation
The viewer requires Python 3 (in any version). I recommend using the virtual environment, which can be builded using the setup.sh script.

# Activating the virtual environment
Once you've exited the application, the virtual env can be reactived using "source venv/bin/activate" on Unix systems.
